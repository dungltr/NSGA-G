# Applying NSGA-G to estimate parameters in SIDARTHE model for COVID-19
It is an application of NSGA-G for the problem which has entire data or lack data of variables in SIDARTHE.
# Using:
NSGA-G should be use and complied with MOEA framework
# Data:
The data is taken from the website: https://data.humdata.org/
# Experiment:
1. With Italia: src/sida/ExperiementPeriod.java
2. With kazakhstan: src/sida/ExperimentTotal.java
# Simualtion: 
1. Italia: matlab/ita/2020_05_05_14_22_49_NSGAS_P_100_Evolution_1000000/Sidarthe_Simulation_Dung45.m
2. Kazakhstan: matlab/kaz/2020_05_11_00_23_50_NSGAS_P_100_Evolution_1000000/Sidarthe_Simulation_Dung39.m
