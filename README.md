# Applying NSGA-G[2,3] to estimate parameters in SIDARTHE[1] model for COVID-19
It is an application of NSGA-G algorithm for the problem which has entire data or lack data of variables in SIDARTHE.
# Using:
NSGA-G should be use and complied with MOEA framework[4]
# Data:
The data is taken from the website[5].
# Experiment:
1. With Italia: src/sida/ExperiementPeriod.java
2. With kazakhstan: src/sida/ExperimentTotal.java
# Simualtion: 
1. Italia: matlab/ita/code/Sidarthe_Simulation_Dung45.m
2. Kazakhstan: matlab/kaz/code/Sidarthe_Simulation_Dung49.m
